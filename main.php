    <h2>Bosses</h2>
    <h4>King Krusha K. Rool</h4>
    <img src="assets/king.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>The King of the Kremlings. Donkey Kong's mortal enemy. This fight will test the player like never before. All Kongs will have a turn in battering the king of Kremlings
      in order to stop him. Be warned, King K. Rool does not play fair, as his Kremling minions save him from the bell every knock-down.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/donkeykong.gif" style="height:300px;"><img src="assets/kingkkrool.gif" style="height:300px;">
    <p>Donkey Kong, the first Kong to challenge K. Rool, needs to keep his distance from the Kremling leader. As K. Rool 
    will slam down on the canvas and deliver a devastating blow (as shown on the left). Once K. Rool is in the middle of the ring, barrels will come
    down on top of the ring edges. Which is where DK can get into the barrel and shoot himself to the giant croc (as shown on the right).
    </p>
    <img src="assets/firstphasedk.gif" style="height:300px;"><img src="assets/secondphasedk.gif" style="height:300px;">
    <p>As the player progresses, they will need to use the whole Kong family to defeat K. Rool. 
    Question is, will you be able to stop K. Rool's fury?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Army Dillo</h4>
    <img src="assets/armadillo.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>Army Dillo is the first boss that Donkey Kong faces against in the Jungle Japes level. He has two stages, one is him with the two cannons, with the other not having cannons. DK needs to use the explosive barrel in order to defeat him.
      In the second fight, the Kremlings will upgrade the boss to try and defeat DK. This time, the Army Dillo will have jetpack launchers (as shown on the left) where his rocket launchers are to hover over the ground and slam down to deliver a devastating blow.
      Once the armadillo is finished, he will replace the jetpack with the rocket launchers after a roll back to the center (as shown on the right) to fire at DK once again.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>Dogadon</h4>
    <img src="assets/fly.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>Mother to the baby Dogadon, which was squashed by Diddy Kong, she is the second boss encounter in the Angry Aztec level and is challenged by Diddy himself. Though, this will not be the only time the 
      player will face this beast. In the Fungi Forest level, Chunky Kong finds himself stuck in the same lava pit to face off against Dogadon once more.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Mad Jack</h4>
    <img src="assets/madjack.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>The killer-joke in the box, Tiny Kong challenges Mad Jack to a platform-based fight in the third boss in the Frantic Factory level.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Puftoss</h4>
    <img src="assets/puftoss.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>In the pirate level of Gloomy Galleon, Lanky Kong finds himself trapped in the water with Puftoss.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>King Kut Out</h4>
    <img src="assets/kkutout.jpg" style="height:500px;">
    <p>As the Kongs go through the Creepy Castle level, they are met with the boss himself...King Kut Out? The Kremlings create a cut out of King K. Rool to scare the Kongs, but they do not know that the Kongs see right through the cardboard.
      To defeat this art project, the Kongs need to wait for the Kut Out to appear for them to launch themselves through the cannons and break off the pieces of cardboard from Kut Out (as shown on the left).
      But, the Kongs need to tred carefully, as the Kut Out will shoot lasers out of its eyes while Kremlings dressed as ghosts will distract the Kongs (as shown on the right).
