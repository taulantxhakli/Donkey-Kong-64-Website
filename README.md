  ## Description
This is a website that I came up with for the web development class project. We were instructed to create 4 pages, a logo, navigation menu, footer and the programming languages of HTML, PHP, Javascript and CSS. This website shows a brief guide and instructions on all things DK 64 related. Due to me catching COVID and the time restriction, I was unable to add information on boss doors and golden bananas, but information is there for everything else. 
Video for the boss guide is too large. I have it saved locally if anyone needs it.
